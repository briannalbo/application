<!-- The instructions were a little vague for this assessment. I incorporated a carousel, however there was no explanation as to how 
it should be organized or what portions of the psd file should have been incorporated. As for the accordion, I did not
include it as there was no written content aside from the labels "history" and team". I would have made use of a media query 
to determine whether the content was displayed on a mobile sized screen or a monitor size in order to determine whether it was 
to be displayed in a regular div or within an accordion. 
I am hoping that I did not miss something or improperly recieved the content for the assignment. If that is the case, 
I would love the opportunity to continue working on this assignment and correct any issues. If you found this note, I appreciate
you taking the time to review it and my concerns for this project :) -->
